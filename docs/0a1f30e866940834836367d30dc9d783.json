According to news reporting out of Aksum University by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"The objective of this study was to investigate documentation practice and factors affecting documentation practice among nurses working in public hospital of Tigray region, Ethiopia.\"\nOur news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Aksum University: \"In this study, there were 317 participants with 99.7% response rate. The result of this study shows that practice nursing care documentation was inadequate (47.8%). Inadequacy of documenting sheets AOR = 3.271, 95% CI (1.125, 23.704), inadequacy of time AOR = 2.205, 95% CI (1.101, 3.413) and with operational standard of nursing documentation AOR = 2.015, 95% CI (1.205, 3.70) were significantly associated with practice of nursing care documentation. To conclude, more than half of nurses were not documented their nursing care.\"\n\nAccording to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Employing institutions should provide training on documentation of nursing care to enhance knowledge and create awareness on nurses' documentation to nursing directors and chief executive officer to access adequate documenting supplies besides employing more nurses.\"\n\nFor more information on this research see: Nursing documentation practice and associated factors among nurses in public hospitals, Tigray, Ethiopia.
